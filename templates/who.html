      <p>Hello, my name is Heber, also known as h3bzzz or heeeeeeebrrrrr 
      in the tech community. I am an Ethical Hacker and 
      Software Developer based in Los Angeles, California, with a focus 
      on Web Application Security and Development. My technical expertise 
      spans programming languages, including Golang(echo,GOTH), Python(Flask,Django), 
      JavaScript(AlpineJS,JQuery), PHP(7.2), to build secure, 
      scalable, and performance-driven applications. Over the past several years, 
      I've developed a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles, 
      specializing in identifying vulnerabilities in modern 
      web applications and designing tools to assist with 
      penetration testing and bug bounty hunting. My work often involves 
      developing custom port scanners, endpoint detection systems, 
      and full-stack web platforms that integrate advanced 
      security features. I am deeply committed to continuous learning 
      and staying current with evolving security threats, 
      OWASP methodologies, and emerging technologies. 
      Whether auditing systems for weaknesses, building robust 
      backend infrastructure, or creating tools to support the 
      ethical hacking community, I bring a detail-oriented and 
      security-first mindset to every project I undertake. You'll find
      me down some rabbit hole of knowledge on the wires. Happy Hacking hackers!</p>
